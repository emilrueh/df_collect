Did you know that...
50% of people are living paycheck to paycheck
31% say they already don’t make enough to meet all their financial obligations.
32% of people between 45 and 64 are nearing retirement without any savings
25% of retired people are still in debt with mortgages and consumer debt
## These statistics are shocking and we truly believe our entire population is in a crisis!
Why do these statistics exist....especially amongst working professionals?
To make matters even worse, did you know...
Hundreds of Thousands of people are stuck in the sandwich generation caring for their kids and parents, stretching not only their finances but their time!
The average university graduate finishes school with more than $26,000 in student debt and it takes them an average of 10 years to pay it off
Millions of Millennials are locked out of home ownership because of the rising home prices, debt loads, and inability to save for a down payment.
### Don't be a statistic!
It is time to take charge and start doing things differently!!!
Join us for this Free 60-minute training class where we will show you why Real Estate is the #1 wealth builder and how you can start building wealth today!
As Wealth Builders, we’ve become really good at what we do and have helped ourselves and over 1000 people across the globe take control of their investments and create freedom in their lives!
11 years ago, we knew we needed to build wealth and create freedom in our lives...and maybe some of these points will resonate with you:
""I needed to create extra income so I can be a stay-at-home parent""
""I was concerned with my retirement fund performance and was nervous about the next crash""
""I wanted more freedom and flexibility in my life""
""I wasn’t sure if my pension was still going to be there when it was my turn to retire""
""What would I do if I lost my job and how long could we survive on our income?""
""Inflation was outpacing my raise at work and we were falling behind on our debts""
""Sometimes I just wanted to take 1 extra vacation each year""
""How am I going to pay for the big ticket items in life.....having children, funding their education, retirement, and caring for elderly parents?""
All of these were a concern but we faced a BIGGER problem.
We couldn’t find the answers we were looking for.
### How could we do things differently?
And this is what we will be discussing at this FREE 60-minute seminar.
In this class:
*We will share our story, our struggles, and how we started
*We’ll show you 3 different ways you can start building wealth TODAY!
*We’ll share exactly how YOU can get started TODAY!
*This is a previously recorded event.

A Beginners Tutorial of Investing on The Stock Market,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/6/7/1/600_513058993.webp?w=750,,"Investing for Retirement,Stock Investing,Stock Market,Stock Trading,Investing",,,"Discover the secrets to successful stock market investing! Are you intrigued by the idea of making your money work for you? Worried about the risks involved? Well, fear not! Stocks have proven to be the most effective and least risky investment option throughout history.
Now is the perfect time to unlock the potential of the stock market and learn how to maximize your returns. Investing in stocks may seem daunting, reserved only for the pros, but with the right knowledge, it can be surprisingly simple.
If you're a novice investor or considering reentering the market, mark this event as a MUST on your calendar! Don't miss out on the opportunity to gain valuable insights.
Let's talk about the returns. Ultimately, people invest in the stock market to make money, and when done correctly, you can expect an average growth of 7-10% over the long term. Picture this: £10,000 invested now with an average growth of 7% would blossom into £20,000 in just 10 years. That's a remarkable return compared to what you'd achieve with a traditional savings account!
Sure, property investment often grabs attention, but it comes with tying up your money and hefty maintenance costs. On the other hand, stocks are quick, easy, and inexpensive to trade. That's why they're known as ""liquid assets"" – offering you flexibility and potential profits.
We're thrilled to have Jonathan, a Chartered Accountant with over 45 years of stock market experience, as your host for this event. From his early investment days to learning from top investors worldwide, Jonathan's background provides him with the best of both worlds. His infectious enthusiasm for the subject and passion for sharing his acquired knowledge make him the perfect guide.

Learn How You Can Invest Successfully On The Stock Market,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/b/1/5/600_505995125.webp?w=750,,"Investing for Retirement,Stock Investing,Stock Market,Stock Trading,Investing",,,"Should you invest in the stock market?
Would you like to know how?
Investing in stocks may sound complicated and only for the professional investor but with the right inside knowledge it is actually very simple.
If you have never invested before or are thinking about getting back into the market - this event is a MUST!
Ultimately people invest in the stock market to make money and done correctly you can make on average 7-10% over the long term. To put that into perspective £10,000 invested now at an average growth of 7% would be worth £20,000 in 10 years - a lot better than you will achieve with a savings account!
People worry about the risk involved in the stock market but historically stocks have been the most effective and least risky option, bar none, for investors.
You hear a lot about property investment but it ties up your money and there can be a lot of costs involved in maintenance and when you come to sell. Stocks on the other hand are quick, easy, and inexpensive to trade which is why they are often referred to as 'liquid assets'.
I am really pleased to have been able to get Jonathan to agree to do this presentation and am sure that you will get massive benefit from it. Register for the event today and start learning how you can make money by investing in stocks NOW!
Who Is Jonathan Horrocks?
Jonathan is your host for the event. His background really gives him the best of both worlds being a Chartered Accountant and somebody with over 45 years of investment experience in the stock market. He started investing at an early age and went on to train with some of the top investors in the world.
His enthusiasm for the subject is infectious and he loves nothing better than sharing his acquired knowledge, teaching people how to invest the correct way.

Across 3 months, 21 Angel Investors together reviewed 60+ companies who shared company financials, business strategies, customer references, and operating plans. We held individual and group investor discussions, where we evaluated, selected, debated about, and did meaningful due diligence.
This Demo / Pitch Night is the end of the program. It is an exclusive virtual reception during which participating companies have the opportunity to pitch to an audience of entrepreneurs, mentors, investors, and community members.
The 5 finalist companies will present. The Due Diligence teams will outline what they explored in the process of due diligence. And then the Angel investors will select a company to make an investment in. The audience is invited to also vote for an Audience Award.
Many Angel Groups will be invited to attend. Many will be there. There will be time to network and engage with other attendees. This is an online event.

But the main reason is because Charles will be joined by the very effective Jay Hastings. Jay is getting the great results, so he is the one to take advice from.
One of Jay's great contributions to the Digital education scene is his correct view that we have to become a more evolved version of ourselves if we are to expect different results.
May I suggest that we could also practice this at its most basic level by making sure we turn up for this webinar, which you are joining. It's a simply sign of serious intent, if you actually want change. Make the commitment now!!
Learn My 3-Step Formula For Successful Money Management Without Sacrificing Quality Of Your Life
Learn simple money tips to get control of your finances, change your money mindset, build wealh and become financially free.
We are living through are challenging times - inflation, higher interest rates and economic downturn. Despite this, there are always opportunities and there are always people who do well in any economy.
What can you do to not only survive, but thrive regardless of external events?
What’s going on in your own internal economy, and in your head, will have more influence on your financial success than external events.
Recent events have shown us that when things go wrong, like a job loss or higher bills, most people have no back-up plan or savings to get them through a short term crisis.
Learning to manage your money is the first step towards building wealth and becoming financially free.
In this free live online training, I’m going to show you how to get control of your finances in 28 days without sacrificing your enjoyment of life.

If you are a non-technical person with an idea for an app, you’re probably looking for a technical co-founder to help you build the app.
However, you can launch a tech startup by outsourcing code!
In the early days of your startup it can be challenging to attract a technical co-founder to build your app. But by knowing how to efficiently outsource the building of your MVP and gain some traction, you can de-risk the opportunity for the tech person and change the conversation from ""I Need You"" to ""Here's an Opportunity"".
In this webinar, the speaker will discuss the best way to outsource the development of your app, including:
Why outsourcing may be the best way to find a technical co-founder
Outsourcing best practices
How not get ripped off in the process
and more!

Scrum Sprechstunde Online,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/2/4/3/600_510585635.webp?w=750,,,,,"Hallo zusammen,
im Dezember 2020 gab es die letzte sogenannte ""Agile Sprechstunde"" - ein Projekt anlässlich zu meinem zehnjährigen Jubiläum als Scrum Master.
Im Laufe der Zeit ist das Interesse an Fragen rund um Scrum nicht abgerissen, weshalb ich mich in dieser Sprechstunde explizit diesem umfangreichen Thema widmen möchte.
Du willst Scrum Master*in werden und brauchst mehr Informationen über den Weg dorthin? Du willst dich als Scrum Master*in selbstständig machen? Oder du hast Fragen zu deinem Scrum Team, bzw. willst die Rolle der Product Owner*in besser verstehen? Ich gehe auf jede gestellte Frage ein!
Natürlich können wir auch auf Methoden gucken, überlegen, wie du deine Retrospektive vorbereiten kannst oder welche Fallstricke in einem Vorstellungsgespräch auftauchen können. Und für die Profis unter euch können wir selbstverständlich auch über Agile Transformationen sprechen und welche Herausforderungen dir hierbei begegnen, bzw. wie wir sie lösen könnten.
Dieses Format findet ab sofort alle zwei Wochen statt und ist auf maximal 9 Teilnehmende begrenzt, damit wir voneinander als Gruppe profitieren können und keine Frage zu kurz kommt.
Ich biete euch einen Raum an, in dem ihr eure Themen und Anliegen mit mir und den anwesenden Teilnehmenden besprechen könnt. Dadurch, dass alle zuhören und mitdiskutieren können, ermöglichen wir jeder Teilnehmer*in ein voneinander Lernen.
Dies ist ein LGBTQ freundliches Format, welches sich außerdem der Förderung von weiblich gelesenen Menschen im Scrum Master*innen Job versteht.
Spielregeln und Ablauf:
Ihr könnt mit der Zoom-App https://zoom.us/support/download oder via Browser teilnehmen.
Ihr könnt jeder Zeit ab 16:00 Uhr dazukommen oder euch wieder ausklinken.
Es ist ein sehr informelles und lockeres Format für Einsteiger und auch Profis.
Wer teilnimmt und eine Frage stellen möchte, kann diese auch optional vorab via Linkedin senden: https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephan-frederik-becker-255bb248
Bringt einfach euer Thema oder eure Frage aus dem Bereich Scrum mit.
Das Schöne an diesem Format: Wer möchte, kann auch einfach zuhören und trotzdem etwas aus den Problemstellungen der anderen lernen.
Wir haben eine Timebox von 45 Minuten, damit dieses Meeting für alle planbar ist.
Wer mehr zu mir und meinen Ansätzen wissen will oder noch mehr Fragen sowie Antworten sucht, kann mein e-Book lesen: https://bookboon.com/de/new-work-ebook

eXponential Finance Live: Next generation market making with Swaap,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/9/2/6/600_513198726.webp?w=750,,"Financial Planning,Entrepreneurship,Banking,Startup Businesses,Finance",,,"Swaap's mission is to democratize DeFi because it is intrinsically better than the centralized financial system. Swaap does so by providing profitable & passive market making strategies to all types of investors, no matter their level of sophistication and by providing traders with the cheapest prices onchain.
By enabling multi-asset pools with strongly reduced impermanent loss, Swaap enables a new asset class: yield ETFs (index products that collect fees). Since Swaap leverages oracle feeds to implement its approach, Swaap is complementary to traditional AMMs and to Order Books:
- AMMs are probably the best design to trade low cap tokens which could not be listed on Order Books.
- Swaap is a more efficient model to invest & trade on-chain for higher cap tokens which are listed on Order Books.
Recently, Swaap Labs has successfully closed a USD 4.5m seed funding round led by Signature Ventures, alongside New Form Capital, C² Ventures, Kima Ventures, Pareto Ventures, Entrepreneur First and other prominent investors.
This funding will accelerate the development and release of Swaap v2, a revolutionary upgrade to Swaap's Next-Generation Market Making Protocol by offering Liquidity Providers LPs passive, profitable market-making strategies with reduced trading costs and sustainable yields.

You’re probably familiar with Agile “sprints”, and you might have heard the term “sprint” being used in other ways all over the business world. So what are Design Sprints really? And what’s the difference from Agile sprints?
Made popular by Google Ventures, Design Sprints and other spin-offs like the Vision Sprint are used by the most innovative companies in the world. Our two guest speakers Mark Garner and Dee Scarano run sprints for startups and large corporations across industries that range from agriculture in Brazil, to IT infrastructure in Africa, to manufacturing in the United States.
Mark and Dee will focus their talk on the Design Sprint and the Vision Sprint, showing us how they work and why they are such an effective tool (and mindset) for businesses to find strategic clarity, de-risk innovation, and achieve success faster.
About our speakers:
Mark Garner is a strategic design consultant who was an early adopter of Google’s GV Design Sprint Process. He has been working globally, facilitating, training and speaking about the process since 2016. Recently, Mark has been running strategic design workshops and helping startups and corporations to ideate, prototype, and test new company visions using an adapted Design Sprint process.

Es braucht nicht die Größe eines Zalando oder About You, um seinen eigenen Online-Store umzusetzen.

Zudem können E-Commerce-Solutions sehr komplex werden. Es existieren unzählige Anbieter am Markt und scheinbar endlose Möglichkeiten und Features. Das führt zu diversen Risiken bei der Umsetzung eines Shops und zu Integrationsfragen von der Logistik bis zum ERP.

UX Design: How to create Customer Journey Maps & User Flows,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/d/7/3/600_511867539.webp?w=750,,"User Experience,Lean Startup,UI/UX Design,UX Design,Customer Journey Mapping",,,"UX Design is a complex process. There are lots of deliverables that may help to create a solution that will be useful and joyful for customers.
Whereas user flows are concerned with single tasks, user journeys encompass the entire experience a user has with your product or service. On the other hand, a sitemap is a file where you provide information about the pages, videos, and other files on your site, and the relationships between them.
In this live event, the Lean Product Innovator & UX Strategist with +13 years of experience and having designed over 50 application, and leader of one of the best UX Design studios in Germany, Bonanza Design, Behrad Mirafshar, will explore:
👉 The differences between User Journey Maps and User Flows? What is their purpose? How they complement each other?
👉 What is a UX sitemap and what are its benefits?
👉 What methods would you use to develop a customer journey and user maps?
👉 Creating a UX sitemap

Contrary to the conventional approach (waterfall), Agile approach doubles down on the flexibility of tech teams to be responsive to market and customer changes. Not only tech teams, but entire product teams have started adapting their workflows so they can work hand in hand with the dev team.
An agile sprint lasts between one and two weeks on average and offers less wiggle room for UX designers to practice their own design process. That's the source of complaints from many UX Designers.

Have you climbed one set of stairs or taken an alternative route?
The more unconventional, non-linear career path, has often been seen as representing an individual who is unable to commit to a role and unsure of what they want. We want to challenge this assumption, we believe that non-linear career paths provide individuals with room to follow their passions and gather new skills and knowledge that help them evolve along the way. Not everyone can go to university or follow a traditional education, this translates into a non-traditional CV which can be unfairly dismissed in recruitment processes – but taking the road less traveled can be just as, if not more valuable than, following the highway.
On Tuesday 6 June, Futura will be exploring what is really important in the ever-changing job market. Is it your ability to adapt and apply your skillset? Or your educational and professional background?

And, most importantly, learn how you can start your own online business with practically zero costs and no need for a website, social media, or to drive traffic.
Nigel has several shops on Etsy and will share his experience and expertise on print-on-demand, and reveal why it is probably the best online business model out there today.

In traditional organizations, the management hierarchy makes decisions and the workforce carries them out.
So, transitioning to an organization where decision-making is distributed can be a challenge, both for those giving up their decision-making power and those gaining new responsibilities.
It may also not be entirely clear what the alternative to the Hierarchy could be.
In this webinar, we look at the challenge of making the choice to change, the mechanics of making it happen (including some rookie mistakes) and the benefits that accrue from putting decision-making power into the hands of those with the skills and knowledge to take them.
We will look at how to create an organization with a constitution (a set of commonly accepted agreements). These are an agreed set of constraints and freedoms and a way of making decisions in a representative way.
We will also try to give some practical hints about what each person can do to enable colleagues’ engagement and willingness to participate in decision-making.
The results are healthier organizations, more engaged and committed employees and sustainable customer outcomes.

Ich freue mich, euch mitteilen zu können, dass unsere Online-Sitzungen künftig alle zwei Wochen stattfinden werden. Vielen Dank an alle, die sich der Gruppe angeschlossen haben. Ich hoffe, dass die geplante Zeit für uns alle passend ist.
Der Zweck des Treffens ist ganz einfach: Bei den Speedy-Networking-Treffen hat jeder Teilnehmer maximal 2 Minuten Zeit, sich vorzustellen. Nach 2 Minuten ertönt der Gong und ein weiterer Teilnehmer wird gebeten, sich vorzustellen. Wenn nach der ganzen Runde der Vorstellung noch keine 20 Minuten vergangen sind, können die Teilnehmer sich einfach abmelden (ohne etwas sagen zu müssen) und über LinkedIn oder andere Medien individuell mit jedem Vorstellenden in Kontakt treten.
Für einen intensiveren Austausch, bei dem man sich besser kennenlernt und mehr Vertrauen gewinnt, werden die Business Hiking Events einmal im Monat organisiert. Derzeit werden die Business Hiking Events nur in der Schweiz organisiert.
Ich freue mich auf die gemeinsamen Events
Beste Grüsse

Hello everyone,
I am happy to announce that our online meetings will be held every other week going forward. Thank you to everyone who has joined the group. I hope that the scheduled time is convenient for all of us.
The purpose of the meeting is very simple: at the Speedy Networking meetings, each participant has a maximum of 2 minutes to introduce themselves. After 2 minutes, the gong sounds and another participant is asked to introduce themselves. If 20 minutes have not passed after the entire round of introductions, participants can simply sign off (without having to say anything) and contact each introducer individually via LinkedIn or other media.
For a more intensive exchange, where people get to know each other better and gain more trust, the Business Hiking Events are organized once a month. Currently, the Business Hiking Events are only organized in Switzerland.
I am looking forward to the events together
Best regards

To allow you to have quality conversations in a friendly atmosphere, our events are capped to a limited number of participants. Moreover, to get the most out of this format and to maximize your connections, we also limit the participants to 2 people per company.

Reviving the group: Let's talk AI over networking and food on June 23rd,,,"Linguistics,Technology,Language Translations,Language & Culture,Software Development",,,"Hello :)
How are you? It's been a very long time...
Are you interested in the fascinating world of AI and its potential applications? Do you want to network with like-minded individuals and enjoy some delicious food while discussing the topic?
Then mark your calendar for June 23rd, because we've got something special in store for you.
We're inviting you to our office and garden located in Puschkinallee 39 (in Treptower Park) for an informal gathering to discuss the latest advancements in AI (text, voice, images). We hope to bring back the ""localization meetup group"" together and an opportunity to exchange ideas and insights with individuals who share your interests, all while enjoying some mouth-watering treats and refreshing beverages.
At Altagram & Alocai, we believe that AI (and LLM) has the potential to transform various industries and sectors, and we're excited about exploring the different ways in which it can be applied to solve complex challenges in localization. We also recognize that the development of LLM technology should be done with ethical considerations and a deep understanding of its potential impact on society. Through this event, we hope to foster a community of individuals who share our passion for AI and are committed to advancing the field in a responsible and sustainable manner, regardless of their backgrounds or experience levels.
So, if you're interested in attending, all you need to do is RSVP by the 9th of June. We'll take care of the rest, including providing the venue, food, and drinks. All you need to bring is your curiosity and a willingness to engage in thought-provoking discussions.
We look forward to meeting you on June 23rd from 6pm!

(This event is part of PB's 5th anniversary and a series of events in Berlin with global impact blockchain ecosystem members from INATBA, the IOTA Foundation, EUBOF, BC 100+, Berlin Partners, BerChain, UNIC. More info on the events here.
Carbon or Environmental credits have existed since decades and started to see a growth in adoption and attention in the past year because of their potential to solve some of our burning climate change issues. However, the current market are frequently judged opaque, unorganised, and fragmented.
E﻿ntrepreneurs and creatives in the blockchain and web3 space have seen opportunities since 2016 to address some of these issues. With the increase in maturity and democratization of technologies such as Smart Contracts, Tokenization, NFTs, Oracles, DAOs, and more, a real ecosystem has emerged in the carbon x web3 space.
W﻿e can now count hundreds of projects active in the carbon value chain, whether it is in the origination of funding of environmental projects, data verification (dMRV), tokenization and trading, or offsetting.
W﻿here are we in 2013? How does the ecosystem look like and what are the current trends and challenges? Is the web3 approach solving or adding more fragmentation? Is the idea of a unique environmental token a good or bad one?
J﻿oin us in this exciting meetup to dive more into the web3 x carbon space.
Whether you already know about this market, are a carbon or ReFi expert or are new to it, come to the exclusive opportunity and get to know the community!

Este Café Grupal SÚPER PIONEROS es una evolución de los almuerzos y Cafés online que realizamos donde las plazas se agotan a toda velocidad, donde han nacido tantísimas sinergias entre cracks tecnológicos y donde muchas personas se han quedado fuera. Este nuevo formato permite aprender de temáticas de forma online así como poder presentarnos para tener visibilidad.
Estamos muy contento de ir retomando los encuentros presenciales para conocer a toda la Comunidad SÚPER PIONEROS, la semana pasada fue una pasada volver a ver tantísimos miembros en Open Expo Madrid y vienen muchas más paradas (un adelanto Murcia, Málaga y más...). Nuestro reto es llegar a los 50K miembros a final de año y para ello no vamos a parar de hacer cosas. ¡GRACIAS!!
El Café Súper Pioneros grupal está dirigido por José Luis Cáceres, ingeniero industrial y emprendedor en internet desde 1997 con gran experiencia en validación, desarrollo y aceleración de ideas innovadoras.
Actividades del encuentro.
- En el encuentro aprenderás más sobre WEB3, Blockchain y cripto alrededor de los juegos.
- En el encuentro podrás presentarte al grupo y pedir un deseo.
- En el encuentro conseguirás recursos, visibilidad y apoyo para tu idea, aprender o participar.
José Luis es actualmente Chief Brand Officer Bit2Me y CEO de NWC10Lab, este pequeño gran laboratorio de ideas digitales especializado en tecnología WEB3, blockchain y cripto donde ya somos más de 30K SÚPER PIONEROS aprendiendo y ayudando a los emprendedores más disruptivos del momento.

In these challenging times of inflation, rising interest rates, and economic uncertainty, there is still a path to prosperity.
Despite external factors, individuals can thrive in any economy with the right approach.
But how can you not only survive but thrive, regardless of external events?
The key lies within your own internal economy and mindset, which have a greater impact on your financial success than external circumstances.
Recent events have revealed a stark reality: many people lack a backup plan or savings to weather short-term crises like job loss or unexpected bills.
That's why learning to master your money is crucial – it's the first step toward building wealth and attaining financial freedom.

wir haben wieder ein interessantes Thema für euch im Angebot. Gerrit Beine wird uns in das Thema ""Die Ökonomie von Gut und Crypto. Eine Kritik."" einführen.
Worum geht's?
In diesem Vortrag sollen die Folgen von Crypto-Währungen betrachtet werden.
Gerrit Beine zeigt euch im Vortrag die sozialen, ökonomischen und ökologischen Probleme, die das Experiment
Crypto-Währungen nach sich zieht. Dabei geht es um Umwelt im Sinne von Natur, aber auch im Sinne von
lebenswertem Raum. Es geht um Existenzen von Menschen und von Staaten. Er zeigt, warum die Crypto-Währungen
keines ihrer Versprechen zu Dezentralisierung und Freiheit einhalten können. Mehr noch, es zeigt sich deutlich, dass
die Parallelgesellschaften, die durch solche Systeme entstehen, alle Entwickler:innen zwingen, sich moralischen Fragen zu stellen.
Ziel ist es, dass nach dem Vortrag ein Bewusstsein für die Probleme, die mit dem Einsatz von Crypto-Währungen einhergehen, besteht.
Gerrit Beine - Kurzprofil:
Gerrit Beine ist seit 1998 in der IT unterwegs, seit 2001 mit agilen Methoden. Er baut gerne Brücken zwischen Softwarearchitektur und Organisationen.
Dauer:
Der Vortrag selbst wird ca. 60 Minuten dauern, im Anschluss folgt gerne noch ein Q&A.

Das Tool ChatGPT wird zunehmend genutzt, um Texte, als auch andere Anwendungen schneller zu erstellen und zu vereinfachen. Wir nutzen es aktiv heute schon, um Workshops vorzubereiten, für Social Media Content zu produzieren und auch zum Teil für inhaltliche Recherchen und Kundenprojekte.
Wie das funktioniert und was die besten Prompts und Befehle sind, wollen wir dir in einem Meetup vorstellen. Das Meeup läuft so ab, dass wir dir einige Dinge zu den Inhalten vorstellen werden und uns auch in der Community austauschen, um voneinander zu lernen.
Was sind beispielsweise die besten Befehle/Prompts, die du kennst?
Die Inhalte und der Austausch des Meetups werden dokumentiert und du erhältst diese im Nachgang per Mail zugeschickt, so dass du eine Zusammenfassung des Termins hast.
Gemeinsam ist es einfacher neue Dinge zu lernen. Aus dieser Motivation heraus, haben wir das Meetup gegründet und es ist ein einmaliges ""ChatGPT SPECIAL"" in der Reihe der Krypto und AI Meetups. Durch Austausch, Wissenstransfer und Erfahrungen lernen wir voneinander schneller als alleine.

KI Park TechTalk: AI discovers cause for scrap in complex variant production,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/e/1/600_511503041.webp?w=750,,"New Technology,Natural Language Processing,Data Science,Artificial Intelligence,Big Data",,,"This presentation focuses on the root cause discovery for minor quality in high-variant automotive supply production. With the help of self-learning and explaining AI, complex root-cause findings can be reduced from several days to hours.
High variant complexity is caused by the production of around 11,000 transmissions per day in 700 variants. Every transmission consists of up to 600 parts. There are various suppliers and almost 1,000 machineries in the plant.
Why are semantic networks and thus explanatory AI needed?
The domain experts want to understand why an AI decides how. They do not want to understand the algorithms behind it, but want the reasons to be presented transparently from their domain point of view. On the one hand, this ensures acceptance, but on the other hand, complex disturbing factors are uncovered. From this, domain experts can derive modified procedures or processes.
Why are self-learning algorithms and thus adaptive AI needed?
In such a multi-variant production, the processes are very complex and constantly changing.
Only an AI that permanently brings added value - and not just for a limited period of time - can assert itself here. Therefore, the AI must adapt to the changes. It is only worthwhile for companies to introduce and roll out AI if this AI makes the adjustments itself, i.e. without the intervention of data scientists.
The Speaker of the Tech Talks is Britta Hilt.
Britta Hilt has focused on Artificial Intelligence since 2011, mainly from a usage perspective. She is co-founder and managing director of the AI company IS Predict which has focused on automating Data Science as well as on explaining AI.

It may sound complicated.
I get it, you don't know where to start but you are missing one of the best online business opportunities today.
All you need is a laptop and an internet connection, you can work from anywhere and it costs almost nothing to set up.
Many confuse it with printing e-books or self-publishing. It is nothing like that. It is a process where you create very simple designs on your laptop, which you put onto a range of products from mugs to t-shirts, phone cases to keyrings. Better still, you link your shop to a specialist manufacturer who makes your items, packs them and ships them. You don't even have to see your products.
You don't need to be an artist or have any artistic ability - our guest speaker for this event, Nigel Wymer hasn't! If you can type your name, you can create a bestselling print-on-demand product.
Nigel has been making a living exclusively online for over 16 years. He will explain why Etsy is the best marketplace to start your new business empire.

How to utilize AI in a print on demand business on Etsy,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/0/e/600_503225134.webp?w=750,,"Cashflow,Business Strategy,Professional Networking,Building an Online Business,Network Marketing",,,"Maybe you have heard about print-on-demand? Or maybe you have looked into this fantastic opportunity but don't know where to start?
Join Nigel Wymer on this informative presentation to learn the essential steps to setting up a successful print-on-demand business.
Print-on-demand or POD, as it is often referred to, is a massive opportunity for anyone wanting to work from home, either for a lucrative side income or to replace your 9-5.
Print-on-demand is the massively growing market that anyone can do, you don't need to be artistic or be able to draw, you just need to take action and follow the process Nigel explains.
In addition, the innovation that is AI - artificial intelligence, has made things even easier, allowing you to use AI, completely free of charge to create unique images and funny quotes for your designs. You can even get it to write your item titles and descriptions and research keywords to get your items ranked.
As a challenge Nigel opened a brand new print-on-demand shop on Etsy selling just mugs. Within 18 weeks he had made over 600 sales and his shop was ranked in the top 8% of performing shops. In this session he will spill the beans on how you can do it too.
Print-on-demand is predicted to grow by 33% over the next 3 years with demand for personalized products predicted to grow at an even higher rate. And you can set it up for almost zero cost - you never see your items, do not have to buy stock until it is sold and you don't even have to pack or post anything - your chosen manufacturer will do it all for you.
It sounds too good to be true doesn't it? But, it is probably the best online business model out there today - a genuine opportunity to start your own online business with no need for a website or social media or to drive traffic.
Nigel has many years of experience with several highly successful shops and has earned six figure sums from selling on Etsy, his chosen marketplace for starting a POD business. He will explain why you should start your business on Etsy and not eBay or Amazon.

Food/snacks
We won't offer any food or snacks, but there are some for sale at the bar and 🤞 the nice samosa man will come by at some point. There's also a few options very close by for falafel, baked goods, and so on.

Models of digital product development service,,,"Outsourcing,Technology,Product Management,Digital Product Marketing,Lean Product Management",,,"This panel is brought to you by Serbian Product Community in collaboration with our partner Zuhlke.
The Serbian IT market still predominantly offers software development and similar services. In the last couple of years, there's been a shift to offer customers more value by introducing another service layer and offering a service of discovering and delivering digital products.
Different companies offer different business models for that, the value they deliver through it, different ways of working, and similar but different roles that manage that kind of service.
Through this panel, we're looking to understand and look at a few of those models comparatively to better understand their similarities and differences.
Panelists:
Nikolina Belić - Principal Product Manager @Vega IT
Karatina Samardžić - Lead IT Project Manager @ Zuhlke
Dunja Stanivuković - Lead IT Project Manager @ Zuhlke
Igor Gašović - Engineering and Delivery Manager @ HTEC
Host:
Ana Pegan
Questions the panel will answer:
What services does your company offer?
What models of collaboration and payment do you use for them?
Who are the clients you work with, and who are maybe the type of clients you don't work with?
How does that collaboration look like?
What does the role that manages the service of product development look like?
How do you measure the success of the services provided?

❓Welche Features sollten wir entwickeln, damit sich die Conversion Rate verbessert?
❓Sind die Features, die durch Stakeholder auf die Roadmap gewandert sind dazu geeignet, unsere KPI zu treiben?
❓Kann unser Team die Kennzahl überhaupt beeinflussen?
Frust macht sich breit, wenn sich die KPI einige Zeit lang nicht verändert. Initial wirkte es ""empowerend"", die Kennzahl selbst treiben zu dürfen. Mittlerweile ist das Team entmutigt und konzentriert sich lieber auf Aufgaben, bei denen es weiß, wie es sie angehen kann.
Die Kennzahl - wie zum Beispiel eine Conversion-Rate - ist nur noch Makulatur. Sie wird hin und wieder angeschaut, aber im Alltag des Teams spielt sie kaum eine Rolle.
Wir bei unserem Event ""Conversion Rate Optimierung"" stellen uns der Herausforderung! Wir erforschen, was Dein Produkt wirklich voranbringen kann. Statt nur den Fokus auf die Entwicklung neuer Features zu legen, eröffnen wir Dir den Blick für alternative Ansätze.
Wir leiten Dich durch effektive Discovery-Methoden und Research-Strategien, die Dein Team näher an die echten Nutzererfahrungen bringen. Dabei sammelt ihr Erkenntnisse über die echten Bedürfnisse Deiner Nutzer.

We are partnering this month with GfK for our Meetup.
We are thrilled to announce our upcoming Green Coding and Infrastructure meet-up, which will take place on May 31st at the brand-new GfK Berlin Office. As a global player in the data insights industry, GfK is obviously keen to act and think future-oriented. Therefore, they are committed to sustainability and reducing their carbon footprint, and this event is part of GfK’s efforts to promote eco-friendliness in the tech industry.
The event is supposed to bring together like-minded professionals, developers, and enthusiasts who are passionate about green coding practices and want to make a positive impact on the environment. We will have two speaker slots for experts to share their insights, ideas, and experiences on green coding and sustainability in the tech industry.
Agenda:
18.30 – 19.00: Welcome & free Snacks & Drinks
19.00 – 19.30: Green IT and sustainability in the Cloud
19.30 – 20.00: Understanding Software Carbon emissions
As of 20.00 Q&A and Socializing
Bernhard Günther (Principal Site Reliability Engineer, GfK) will give a short presentation about Green IT and sustainability in the Cloud to feed an emerging discussion. As the cloud gives you a lot of freedom it also forces you to take the responsibility to plan your cloud infrastructure sustainable yourself.
Arne Tarara will share insights on Understanding Software Carbon emissions. Software uses no physical resources directly, but the underlying infrastructure. In order to help developers contribute to the worlds carbon neutral target it is key to understand where carbon emissions from software come from and how they can be identified. Arne, a software engineer from Open-Source company Green Coding Berlin, will give an overview over current models and frameworks for classifying and attributing software carbon share and current limitations with these approaches. He will present some Open-Source tools that make energy cost and carbon emissions visible for a developer to drive energy consumption and carbon emissions down.
In addition to the speakers, there will be enough time for networking and discussion among attendees. We encourage everyone to bring their own ideas and questions to share with the community.

Vom Big Picture EventStorming zu Architektur und Code,https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/1/7/6/600_511692662.webp?w=750,,"Web Development,Software Architecture,Software Development,Software Craftsmanship,Agile Coaching",,,"Domain Driven Design (DDD) umfasst eine Vielzahl spezieller Konzepte, wie zum Beispiel Aggregates, Bounded Contexts, EventStorming, Ubiquitous Language und Value Objects. Über Eric Evans grundlegendes Werk – “the Blue Book” – hinaus, gibt es viele hochwertige Informationsquellen. Allzu oft sind sie jedoch sehr spezifisch, sprich, mit hohem Zoom-Faktor.
In diesem Vortrag werden wir verschiedene DDD-Konzepte “im Vorbeigehen”
behandeln und sie zu einem Großen Ganzen zusammenfügen. Wir beginnen mit dem Big Picture EventStorming, das als ""Quasi-Standard” für eine erfolgreiche Discovery gilt. Davon ausgehend werden wir uns an folgenden Leitfragen orientieren.
Was sind die nächsten Schritte “am Tag danach”, nach dem Big Picture Workshop?
Warum sind gut geschnittene Bounded Contexts so wichtig und wie kann man gute Kandidaten bestimmen?
Wie funktioniert Context Mapping aus dem “Strategic DDD” und welche Rückschlüsse liefert es?
Sind “taktische DDD-Patterns” mit einer hexagonalen Architektur vereinbar?
Wie kann man rasch Code entwickeln, um frühzeitiges Feedback von Benutzern zu erhalten?
Abschließend folgt ein persönliches Fazit zu DDD und der Motivation dahinter. Als Steilvorlage für kontroverse Diskussionen und zahlreiche Fragen direkt im Anschluss.

Über den Sprecher:
Max Jung bringt umfassende Expertise aus vielen Jahren Software-Entwicklung in verschiedensten Branchen, Projekten und Rollen ein. Schon bevor er Domain Driven Design kennenlernte, verfolgte er einen Modell-zentrierten Ansatz mit Fokus auf der Fachlichkeit. In den letzten Jahren konnte er seine Erfahrungen als EventStorming Facilitator weiter ausbauen und leitete Workshops für 7 bis über 40 Teilnehmer. Ab dem 1. Juli 2023 ist Max als selbstständiger Software-Berater tätig.
Seine Leistungen reichen von der Mitarbeit in Projekten als pragmatischer Solutions Architect und Fullstack-Entwickler, über individuelle Trainings und Coaching in Bereichen wie sinnvoll angewandtem DDD, Architektur und Agilität bis hin zur professionellen Facilitation von EventStorming Workshops und ähnlichen Formaten.",,Online event,Online event,,"June 13, 2023",7:30 PM,Free,https://www.meetup.com/digital-craftsmanship-nordoberpfalz/events/291863033,code

I feel we spent too much time in Java. To balance this, let's take some (intentional) messy TypeScript code and clean it.
Among the learning points:
Mastering Array operators
FP principles: avoid mutation, pure functions
OOP: identify new value objects to enrich code semantics
Baby-steps refactoring taking small safe steps
TypeScript-specific tricks and clean code rules
Prep-work:
Just watching is fine, but if you want to become better at refactoring and crafting software, I will invite you to clone the original code and spend 2-4 hours refactoring it before attending this event (instructions are in the project readme):
https://github.com/victorrentea/kata-yatzy-ts
⭐️ Post your solution
If you refactored the exercise and are happy with the results, please post a comment to this event with the git link to the refactored version, plus the time it took to refactor it.

EVENT DESCRIPTION
""Automated Testing"" workshop by Radu Nicoara
************************************************
Join us for an interactive workshop deep-diving into the world of automated testing! This event is perfect for anyone with some coding experience that is curious about how to get started with writing tests.
We will write unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests together, all using only JavaScript.
We will learn how to do test-driven-development (TDD), and how to make sure that the code that we write actually does what it is supposed to, and that it won't get modified in unexpected ways down the road.
As a pre-requisite, you should have some prior knowledge of JavaScript and bring a laptop with you.

Creative Code Stammtisch [LIVE @ CO-UP],,,,,,"The Creative Code Stammtisch is an open conversation between artists, makers, designers, coders, performers, learners and anyone interested in the use of computing skills for artistic expression. The event is free and open to all, regardless of age, origin, gender or experience. Beginners and first-timers should feel especially welcome! You don't have to be a coder yourself 😃
NOTE: Find the covid rules at the bottom.
NOTE 2: Due to construction, the space is currently only accessible via the temporary walkway located at Adalbertstr. 5-6 (next to the Kreuzberg Merkezi building). For a map and more detailled instructions, see https://co-up.de/about/ or watch this video
WHAT SHOULD I EXPECT?
There is a time for people to present something if they want to, followed by informal discussions. Every topic is fair game, from net art to computational design and interactive installations all the way to wearable electronics and generative literature... It's a whole evening packed with fun, inspiration and human connection.
Join us on Friday and see for yourself, ask questions if you want, contribute with your comments and maybe show a project you're working on. We're looking forward to meet you all!
Note that this event is NOT just for coders! If you like art and/or technology, you will certainly enjoy yourself, and perhaps even learn something!
A NOTE ON DIVERSITY
We do our best to create a welcoming environment for all people regardless of race, ethnicity, color, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, or genetics. People from group generally underrepresented in open-source, art, and technology fields are warmly encouraged to come by. And if you don't belong to an underrepresented group yourself, we kindly ask you to pause for a minute and think of a friend who does and would enjoy this meetup, and invite them to join... seriously, just stop reading and do it 🙈
SAFE SPACE POLICY
We support the Berlin Code of Conduct:
berlincodeofconduct.org (http://berlincodeofconduct.org/)
Please read and make sure you agree with its content.
ACCESSIBILITY
Co.up rooms are located on the third floor, so we will happily provide assistance with the elevator to those you if you need it. Please let us know in advance as there is an elevator key in the space. We're very sorry to say that co.up's bathrooms are not wheelchair accessible, but there are some accessible bathrooms nearby, including at the Wilhelm Liebknecht/Namik Kemal Bibliothek, Möbel Olfe, and Südblock.

Jeudi 1 juin 2023 aura lieu un nouveau meet-up ! Il sera en visioconférence et accessible à tous. L'objectif est de présenter l'investissement en crowdfunding immobilier.
Le crowdfunding immobilier est une bonne solution de diversification, qui apporte un certain niveau de rendement, mais dont les risques sont à étudier en détail. Facile à mettre en place, le crowdfunding immobilier consiste à participer au financement d'une opération immobilière, rapportant ainsi un rendement distribué en coupons.

Mardi 13 juin 2023 aura lieu un nouveau meet-up ! Il sera en visioconférence et accessible à tous. L'objectif est de présenter les différents moyens d'optimiser sa fiscalité en France.
Impôt sur le revenu, impôt sur les sociétés, flat tax, IFI... Dois-je faire de la réduction d'impôt ou de la déduction d'impôt ? D'ailleurs, quelle différence ? Et le crédit d'impôt qu'est-ce donc ?
La fiscalité est parfois (très souvent*) complexe en France, il existe une multitude de méthodes pour optimiser ses impôts et on peut facilement s'y perdre. Une chose à retenir : il n'existe pas de solution magique et chaque investissement comporte un risque. Le but de ce meet-up va être d'éclaircir tout cela et de prendre du recul sur les différentes solutions qui existent.

Mercredi 31 mai 2023 aura lieu un nouveau meet-up ! Il sera en visioconférence et accessible à tous. L'objectif est de présenter le fonctionnement de l'Assurance Vie.
Quand on pense à l’assurance vie, on imagine une assurance décès ou quelque chose lié uniquement à la transmission et succession de patrimoine, la faute au nom qu’on lui a donné. L’assurance vie permet en effet d’investir sur les marchés financiers, en obtenant une fiscalité avantageuse après quelques années. Elle permet de construire une stratégie d’investissement sur mesure en composant son contrat d’unités de compte (et également de fonds en euro). Nous allons voir concrètement quel intérêt il y a à souscrire à une Assurance Vie (voir à plusieurs), comment cela fonctionne et quels sont les performances potentielles sur différentes durées d'investissement.

Mardi 6 juin 2023 aura lieu un nouveau meet-up ! Il sera en visioconférence et accessible à tous. L'objectif est de présenter le fonctionnement de l'Assurance Vie.
Quand on pense à l’assurance vie, on imagine une assurance décès ou quelque chose lié uniquement à la transmission et succession de patrimoine, la faute au nom qu’on lui a donné. L’assurance vie permet en effet d’investir sur les marchés financiers, en obtenant une fiscalité avantageuse après quelques années. Elle permet de construire une stratégie d’investissement sur mesure en composant son contrat d’unités de compte (et également de fonds en euro). Nous allons voir concrètement quel intérêt il y a à souscrire à une Assurance Vie (voir à plusieurs), comment cela fonctionne et quels sont les performances potentielles sur différentes durées d'investissement.

En juin, laissez-vous guider par Giulia FRANCESCHINI lors d’une conférence gratuite, en ligne sur Félix Vallotton.
Félix Vallotton (1865-1925) : Franco-suisse, peintre, graveur, illustrateur, sculpteur et écrivain, lié pendant un moment au groupe des Nabis. Ses œuvres peintes et dessinées sont assez tôt notées par le public : ses peintures sont lourdement critiquées alors que ses œuvres gravées sont louées. Ces dernières vont lui assurer des revenus financiers et vont lui ouvrir les portes de nombreuses revues satiriques dans la dernière décennie du XIX° siècle. Artiste polyvalent, il laissera une œuvre de près de 1700 peintures, quelques 200 gravures, des centaines de dessins et quelques sculptures.

A quoi sert de « libérer sa parole sur l’argent » ?
Des questions ou des problèmes, plus ou moins graves, liés à l’argent nous taraudent bien souvent. Mais l’argent est tabou ; aussi peut-on rarement les exprimer en famille ou avec des amis proches : trop dangereux, trop inconvenant ! Dans ce cas, où en parler ? Avec qui ?
Ce groupe de parole vous permet d’explorer et d’exprimer vos questions, vos émotions, vos difficultés, vos plaisirs et vos projets liés à l’argent, dans un lieu confortable et confidentiel.
> Quels bénéfices peut-on en tirer ?
• Explorer des questions intimes en toute sécurité ;
• changer votre regard sur certains problèmes ;
• sortir de la solitude face à vos questions d’argent ;
• retrouver le moral en cas de déprime.
> Comment fonctionne un groupe de parole sur l'argent ?
Voici quelques règles de fonctionnement :
• écoute bienveillante ;
• confidentialité ;
• liberté de parler… ou de ne pas parler ;
• prise de parole à tour de rôle ;
• pas de commentaire ni de jugement sur ce que vous avez dit ;
• à la fin de la séance, nous en faisons le bilan en commun ;
• après la séance, on peut parler ensemble autant qu’on le veut.
L’animateur/l'animatrice facilite le bon déroulement de l’atelier.
> A noter
> L'animateur : Jean Beaujouan, co-fondateur de l'association Osons Parler Argent. Il conduit depuis 1980 des travaux sur l’argent comme objet social et psychologique (animation d’ateliers, de séminaires et de conférences).
