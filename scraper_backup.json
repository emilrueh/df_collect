Are you intrigued by the idea of making your money work for you? Worried about the risks involved? Well, fear not! Stocks have proven to be the most effective and least risky investment option throughout history.\nNow is the perfect time to unlock the potential of the stock market and learn how to maximize your returns. Investing in stocks may seem daunting, reserved only for the pros, but with the right knowledge, it can be surprisingly simple.\nIf you're a novice investor or considering reentering the market, mark this event as a MUST on your calendar! Don't miss out on the opportunity to gain valuable insights.\nLet's talk about the returns. Ultimately, people invest in the stock market to make money, and when done correctly, you can expect an average growth of 7-10% over the long term. Picture this: \u00a310,000 invested now with an average growth of 7% would blossom into \u00a320,000 in just 10 years. That's a remarkable return compared to what you'd achieve with a traditional savings account!\nSure, property investment often grabs attention, but it comes with tying up your money and hefty maintenance costs. On the other hand, stocks are quick, easy, and inexpensive to trade. That's why they're known as \"liquid assets\" \u2013 offering you flexibility and potential profits.\nWe're thrilled to have Jonathan, a Chartered Accountant with over 45 years of stock market experience, as your host for this event. From his early investment days to learning from top investors worldwide, Jonathan's background provides him with the best of both worlds.

Have you climbed one set of stairs or taken an alternative route?\nThe more unconventional, non-linear career path, has often been seen as representing an individual who is unable to commit to a role and unsure of what they want. We want to challenge this assumption, we believe that non-linear career paths provide individuals with room to follow their passions and gather new skills and knowledge that help them evolve along the way. Not everyone can go to university or follow a traditional education, this translates into a non-traditional CV which can be unfairly dismissed in recruitment processes \u2013 but taking the road less traveled can be just as, if not more valuable than, following the highway.\nOn Tuesday 6 June, Futura will be exploring what is really important in the ever-changing job market.

With the help of self-learning and explaining AI, complex root-cause findings can be reduced from several days to hours.\nHigh variant complexity is caused by the production of around 11,000 transmissions per day in 700 variants. Every transmission consists of up to 600 parts. There are various suppliers and almost 1,000 machineries in the plant.\nWhy are semantic networks and thus explanatory AI needed?\nThe domain experts want to understand why an AI decides how. They do not want to understand the algorithms behind it, but want the reasons to be presented transparently from their domain point of view. On the one hand, this ensures acceptance, but on the other hand, complex disturbing factors are uncovered. From this, domain experts can derive modified procedures or processes.\nWhy are self-learning algorithms and thus adaptive AI needed?\nIn such a multi-variant production, the processes are very complex and constantly changing.\nOnly an AI that permanently brings added value - and not just for a limited period of time - can assert itself here. Therefore, the AI must adapt to the changes. It is only worthwhile for companies to introduce and roll out AI if this AI makes the adjustments itself, i.e. without the intervention of data scientists.\nThe Speaker of the Tech Talks is Britta Hilt.\nBritta Hilt has focused on Artificial Intelligence since 2011, mainly from a usage perspective. She is co-founder and managing director of the AI company IS Predict which has focused on automating Data Science as well as on explaining AI.\nFor more details please visit https://bit.ly/TechTalk13062023", "Summary": "", "Location": "Online event", "Venue": "Online event", "Gmaps link": "NaN", "Date": "June 13, 2023", "Time": "10:00 AM", "Price": "Free", "Link": "https://www.meetup.com/ki-park-e-v-events/events/292426126", "Keyword": "ai"}, "293746178": {"Name": "Chatbots: Ignite Your Business with Cutting-Edge AI", "Photo": "https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/d/8/600_512763288.webp?w=750", "Category": "", "Tags": "Business Strategy,Building an Online Business,Lead Generation,Artificial Intelligence,Chatbots", "People": "", "Group Size": "", "Long Description": "Get ready to revolutionize the way you do business!
